# Student Management System 
A simple student management system I created to learn OOP concepts in C++

## Usage
Add, Remove, Edit, and View students stored in a vector of Student objects

## Concepts
-Rule of 5
-strings
-vectors
-algorithims
-recursion
-auto, range-based for loops

will add:
-lambda, file stream objects and file handling
-more containers like lists or queues to practice for tests

## Next Steps
-organzize student display in a neat table
-add edit student
-add lambda to remove students function
    -add lambda function to calculate average student gpa
-add more detailed messages for copy and move constructors
    to help me visualize it better

## Recent revisions
-added an individual student display function
-added a helper class "StudentHandler" that uses function objects

## Current Issues
- If the user tries to add a new student and inputs the ID incorreclty, the loop will become infinite
- Messy code, need to create sepearte files for student handler
